	<p class=maincontent>Identified collectively as “Xivren” (loosely meaning “foreigner” or “different” from the Xivlar). By the Xivlar’s arrival, they were sophisticated albeit highly decentralized city-state societies which were in conflict with one another. These societies were based around the enigmatic technology or cultural practice known as Xrikaary and spoke Xivren languages (a sprachbund).</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Before the arrival of the Xivlar, there were multiple waves migrations of various ethnic groups into the isles, establishing distinct, but ultimately convergent societies across the isles. The three main groups under the Xivren grouping are the <a class=bold>Hunters, Seafarers</a> and <a class=bold>City-Builders (Builders)</a>.</p>
	<h3>Hunters (Old Indigenous)</h3>
	<p class=maincontent>The earliest attestable inhabitants were a Paleo-American group who crossed an ice bridge from eastern Canada and reached the Xivallian isles sometime during 11-9,000 BCE, just as the Labrador Ice sheet receded from the isles. These groups were hunter-gatherers following migrating fauna across the ice bridge. They oversaw the Hunter Era of the isles, lasting until the 11th century BC; owing their downfall to warlike seafaring invaders.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Though they were no stranger to violence, the Hunters were primarily concerned with procuring sustenance in a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. The Xivalliah they presided over was sparsely populated and dominated by wildlife. As such, they did not have the martial sophistication to engage in large-scale, protracted conflicts and battles which were common in the Near East. Additionally, they formed no large-scale political entities, maintaining small, disconnected tribal societies. They were excellent outdoorsman and survivalists, living off the land in a semi-nomadic lifestyle.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>The modern Riikscaal languages are the surviving descendants of the Hunters’ languages. They are speculated to be distantly related to the Iroquoian of North America (see <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_people">Mohawk Peoples</a>). Many of the modern Sea-Nomad / Traveller groups speak the Skalinthraal languages, which are Riikscaal – Xivlariin hybrid cryptolects.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>During this time, some Hunter groups would discover an organic substance which, when consumed, granted them heightened senses, physical ability, and limited energy / matter manipulation. This became the earliest form of Xrikaary, a mysterious technology attested. Initially used for recreation, the consumption and practice became a highly ritualized hunting activity. Due to scarce amounts and their limited knowledge of plant cultivation, the practice remained in this rudimentary form and didn’t develop further beyond a hunting and ritual capacity.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Known historical Hunter / Hunter-related groups include the <a class=bold>Travellers, Sonascree</a> and <a class=bold>Krayinscaal.</a></p>
	<h3>Seafarers</h3>
	<p class=maincontent>The second and largest group of indigenous migrating peoples were offshoots of the seafaring marauders (<a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples">Sea Peoples</a>) from the Mediterranean during the <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">Late Bronze Age Collapse</a> (1200-1150s) who sailed westward. They would usher in the Seafarer Era, 11th – 2nd century BC.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>These ancient peoples from the Mediterranean developed seafaring technologies capable of traversing the open ocean, discovering, and migrating in waves across the Xivallian isles during the 12th – 11th century BC. Their exact ethnolinguistic origins are unknown with hypothesized connections with various Mediterranean groups at the time including ancient Iberians, Myceneans, Nuragic or even Amazigh. It is likely they were an amalgamation of similar but distinct tribes. They would dominate the isles over the next few centuries after their arrival, violently displacing or assimilating the hunter-gatherer groups across the isles, pushing them from the habitable lowlands of the mainland by the 9th century BC. During the proceeding millennia, they would establish an extensive seafaring civilization of decentralized martial tribes who often raided one another.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>The Seafarers mainly fall into two classes by way of migration: <a class=bold>Adchvelii</a> and <a class=bold>Undvelii</a>. The Adchvelii refers to tribes who settled the mainland, displacing the Hunters. Further divided into the Northern and Southern groups, geographically separated by the imposing central mountain range. These are merely geographic classifications and does not denote ethnic relations. It is suggested that the incoming tribes were quite disparate, with vastly different origins. Meanwhile, the Undvelii comprises those who continued sailing westwards, discovering, and settling the western isles of Undvelii’On by the late 10th century BC. Credited for their assimilation with the Hunters of the western isles rather than displacing them.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Known for their brutality and prowess in battle, the Adchvelii would militarily dominate the mainland, using their superior weaponry and martial skill to eradicate the indigenous hunters, who can do little to resist the encroaching seaborne conquerors. Those who could sail fled to the western isles and other surrounding isles, whilst others found refuge in the Northern Horn and plateau regions. As they were primarily a seafaring culture, the Adchvelii largely settled the river lowlands and plains, but some acclimatized to the mountainous regions. The Northern Adchvelii tribes were known for their bitter, protracted struggles with the Hunters of the northern plateau. In addition, due to the generally harsher climate and environment north of the central range, they developed into a hardy and fiercely independent people. The Southern Adchvelii enjoyed the pleasant 
		climates and bountiful arable lands below the central mountain range. These benefits allowed higher societal developments. Prominent tribes include: <a class=bold>Kriniinvelii, Harxvelii, Vingrelii, Souunmerii</a>.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>For the Undvelii, their westward migration is indicative of the disunity between the Seafarer groups. It is likely they were displaced from the mainland by competing Adchvelii tribes. It is unknown how their union with the Hunters came to be, but it is evident modern Undvelii groups possess significant paleo-American DNA, with Undvelii languages sharing noticeable linguistics characteristics with Riikscaal; enough to differentiate it from the mainland Adchvelii languages. This peculiar union formed a distinct culture from the mainland, incorporating traits of both Seafarer and Hunter. The most prominent result of this exchange being Xrikaary, which the Undvelii would innovate for martial applications.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Their prominent maritime cultures would allow the increasingly disparate Seafarers tribes to maintain trade relations and wage conflict throughout the millennia.</p>
	<h3>Builders</h3>
	<p class=maincontent>This third and final indigenous group is believed to be a union of native Seafarers and <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Carthage">Carthaginian</a> refugees, who used advanced seafaring skills to cross the Atlantic and reach Xivalliah during the mid 2ndth century BC. They would usher in the <a class=bold>City-State Period</a>.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Amidst the Carthaginian age (400-200s BC?) many intrepid adventurers and merchants embarked on westward ocean voyages inspired by accounts of far-gone lands discovered by ancient seafarers. Surviving travelers documented their journeys, spreading tales of an exotic, albeit chaotic land, inhabited by magicians wielding mystical powers in combat. Leading up to the 2ndth century BC, Carthaginian influence in the Mediterranean declined in favour of the rising Roman power following the <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War">2nd Punic war</a>. Some, fearing a collapse of the Carthaginian state, embarked on an exodus based on tales of past travelers. Inspired by the hope of a new start and guided by ambitious explorers, a few expeditions survived the perilous ocean crossing, reaching Xivalliah at various times between 210-190 BC.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Despite their few numbers, the shrewd and mercantile Carthaginian newcomers would thrive. They would introduce writing, overhaul economic and bureaucratic structures, became prominent figures and steer Xivalliah towards city-states period. Fortunately, at the time of their arrival, the disunited Adchvelii and Undvelii tribes were in perpetual conflict, rife with unstable alliances and tribal loyalties. In their shrewdness, the newcomers would use their diplomatic skills to play local powers against one another, often leveraging their continental goods and trade secrets to gain allies and recruit mercenaries from the local populace. Co-operation of the refugees with local Adchvelii for protection facilitated the construction of the first city-states (with its sophisticated infrastructures) and the realization of a new cultural identity, the Builders. Local tribes
		would greatly admire their city building accomplishments. The Builders’ influence would grow as an increasing number of the native populace relocated to their city-states for the economic benefit and protection from the perpetual strife outside the cities. In essence, the key to the Builders’ success was their ability to provide opportunities to the disparate peoples of Xivalliah beyond warfare or farming.</p>

<h2>The Priscdanyiirn and the Xivlar confederations</h2>

	</div> <!--div for main content text sectionsand p tags for paragraph.-->
	<p class=maincontent>The <a class=bold>Xivlar</a> were a heterogenous confederation of invading tribes tracing their roots from <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns">Hunnic</a> invasion forces in the 4th – 5th century AD. Often identified as the Priscdanyiirn, as the preeminent group within the confederation, they’re comprised of several converging people groups. The first tribes shared a common culture, similar dialects and steppe / semi-nomadic horse warrior culture. It is suggested their common identity came about as a converging of various nomadic groups into a common Eurasian steppe culture. Prior to Hunnic invasions in the 370s, the early Priscdanyiirn tribes inhabited the vast Eurasian steppe. Earliest attestable origins trace their association, at least partially, with Xiongnu, Yuezhi or related nomadic groups living in central Asia in the 2nd - 1st century BC. 
		There is also evidence of their association with the Scythians in antiquity. Most importantly however, there is significant evidence of proto-Turkic or Altaic roots due to linguistic similarities with modern Turkic languages and the placement of their homeland near the Altai mountains.</p>
	<h3>Origins in the Steppe</h3>
	<p class=maincontent> It is hypothesized that the original tribes were displaced from their Eurasian steppe homelands due to political conflicts and climate change. This confederation of migrating tribes was united and led by an enigmatic figure (or group) known as Priscindan (meaning “from the Depths”), a namesake that references their rise from enslavement. Legends claim that Priscindan (b. 190 AD?) and his tribe were a subjugated people, living in servitude under other steppe tribes, often as blacksmiths. Priscindan becomes the leader of a great insurrection amongst subjugated steppe peoples which saw the creation and breakaway of the Priscdanyiirn Confederation from their steppe overlords. Sometime during Priscindan’s reign, the upstart confederation fought against a coalition of steppe tribes, who were threatened by the rising Priscdanyiirn power. 
		These conflicts culminated in a decisive battle (240 AD?) whereby the Priscdanyiirn suffered a devastating defeat, resulting in the loss their homeland and Priscindan’s death. However, the confederation would survive under the leadership of Yoldan and Kasctil, who would initiate the westward migration in search for new lands. At this time, they would increasingly identify themselves as “Wanderers” or “Xivlar(iin)” during a hallmark period of their history known as the “First Exodus”, which marked major developments as a distinct cultural entity.</p>

	<h3>Westward Migrations</h3>
	<p class=maincontent>Around the 270s, the Xivlar would arrive into the Pontic-Caspian steppe, coming into contact with various Iranian peoples (such as the <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alans">Alans</a>, <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a>), whom they would fight, subjugate, and ultimately assimilate into their burgeoning confederation. The Xivlar would remain in the area until the early-4th century AD, having recovered from their losses a century ago. By this time, the confederation was ostensibly assimilated Iranians who’ve adopted the Xivlar language. By the 330s, the Xivlar arrived on the Black Sea Coast, coming into contact with eastern Germanic groups such as the Goths, from whom they would learn about the riches of Europe and the Roman Empire.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Their contact with the Goths kickstarted a devastating Westward migration into Europe in the 350s. It is suggested their invasions kickstarted the barbarian migrations of Europe of the 4th century, becoming the vanguard of the Hunnic Invasions. Their migration continued for 50 years, sprawling across northern Europe. Just as they had with the Iranians of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, they displaced and ultimately assimilated many Germanic groups (<a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals">Vandals</a>, <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths">Goths</a>, <a class=wikilinks href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suebi">Suebi</a>), many of whom joined the confederation.</p>
	<h3>European Migration and Settlement</h3>
	<p class=maincontent>By the early 5th century (410s?), the Xivlar crossed the Rhine and arrived in Roman Hispania. In return for protecting roman territories from other barbarian / hunnic groups as Foederati, they were permitted to settle in the northwestern Hispania (Concurrently with the Suebi). From 420-490, the Xivlar ruled over a thriving kingdom, governing over assimilated Germanic, Iranian, and even Brythonic peoples into their realm. They were famed for their mercenary services in Roman and Visigoth armies, being notorious for their unique steppe horse archery. </p>
	<p class=maincontent>The majority held onto their steppe nomad lifestyle, though some chose to settle, adopting the lifestyle of their countrymen. At the fall of the western roman empire in 476, they would start raiding inland into other areas of Hispania, even so much as expanding southward. This would put them into conflict with other groups such as the Visigoths (the most powerful kingdom in western Europe at the time) for rule over the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Nearing the end of the 5th century, the Xivlar grew emboldened towards seafaring explorations for lands further west. Various factors include overpopulation and limited grazing lands, increasing political pressure from neighboring nations as Visigoths and Suebi, growing alienation and hostility due to their contrasting steppe culture as well as the plausibility of lands further west. The rugged landscape of northwestern Spain was not conducive to their cavalry and horsemanship, their primary method of warfare.</p>
	<p class=maincontent>Recognizing the socio-political climate was upending their steppe culture way of life, many recognized the need to adapt or migrate. This caused a rift in their society between those who favored to settle and abandon their steppe lifestyle and those wanting to continue the steppe tradition elsewhere. Their seafaring expeditions were realized upon the arrival of Brythonic refugees from post-roman Briton fleeing the Anglo-Saxon invasion in the 460s who introduced their maritime culture. They aided the Xivlar in developing the necessary seafaring technologies to traverse ocean.</p>
